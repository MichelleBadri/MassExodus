The original MassExodus code was downloaded from http://www.snl.salk.edu/~navlakha/mass_exodus/
This repo is a direct modification of that original code. We are adding argument parser, additional options, functionality and tweaks for research purposes only.


IMPLEMENTATION OF THE MASS EXODUS GENERATIVE MODEL.
Please cite: S. Navlakha, C. Faloutsos, and Z. Bar-Joseph. MassExodus: Modeling evolving networks in harsh environments. To appear in Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery, 2015.

1. To run the model with n=1000, qsteal=0.3, qcon=0.8, and beta=0.03 with 1000 iterations
    ./mass_exodus.py -n 1000 -s 0.3 -c 0.8 -b 0.03

This will also output statistics of each network at each time step (to standard out) and the final network (override default with -o)

2. See available options
    ./mass_exodus.py -h
